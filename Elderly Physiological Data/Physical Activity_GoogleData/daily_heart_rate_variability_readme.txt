----------

daily_heart_rate_variability_YYYY-MM-DD.csv - Where YYYY-MM-DD is the starting date for the entries in the file.

Each entry has the following values:

    timestamp                                                          - Date and time at which the entry was logged.
    average heart rate variability milliseconds                        - The average of a user's heart rate variability during sleep. Heart rate variability is calculated as the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heartbeat intervals.
    non rem heart rate beats per minute                                - Non-REM heart rate
    entropy                                                            - The Shanon entropy of heartbeat intervals.
    deep sleep root mean square of successive differences milliseconds - The root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) of heartbeat intervals during deep sleep.
    data source                                                        - The origin or source of this data.
